A Kindle Vocabulary to anki flashcards converter.

An open source application designed to facilitate the conversion of Kindle Vocabulary to Anki flashcards, enabling users to effectively study the content they have read on their Kindles.

This application allows to read the vocabulary database for a Kindle device, fetch data from an online dictionary and export the result to a TSV file which can be imported into Anki program. Definitions and other information about words will be stored in a dictionary database.

The Kindle Vocabulary Builder is a powerful built-in tool for readers aiming to improve their language skills. While reading on your Kindle, long-press any word you're uncertain of to reveal a dictionary definition that appears in a pop-up panel. These words are automatically added to your Vocabulary Builder database.

https://apps.ankiweb.net/[Anki] is a powerful, cross-platform flashcard application designed to help you effectively remember information through spaced repetition.

=== How to use
This program is flexible; besides, you can convert directly the Kindle database to a TSV dictionary using the `kindle-to-anki` command. It also allows you to split this process into smaller commands. A common scenario is to export vocabulary from Kindle to a TSV file (`export-vocabulary`) in order to edit the wordlist or add a translation to your specific language. The `export-vocabulary` command can take a date as an optional argument for limiting the outcome.

It's possible to add a single word to the user dictionary using the `definition` command. Since the program prints the definition, it can be used as a makeshift dictionary.

.Available Commands
* export-vocabulary, v: Export kindle vocabulary to a TSV file. By default it will only export vocabulary from the last export.
* import-tsv, i: Import words from a TSV file, fetch information from dictionary and save to the database. It will import vocabulary from the 'vocab.tsv' file  from the configuration folder.
* export-dictionary, d: Export dictionary to a TSV file for Anki
* kindle-to-anki, c: Convert words from kindle database to Anki. Shorcut for export-vocabulary, import-tsv and export-vocabulary
* definition, w: Get a word definition

.run
[source,bash]

java -jar kindle2anki.jar

**Preparation**
Before a conversion you need to create configuration directory in `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/kindle2anki` and add the api key in `config.properties`.
Copy the Kindle database to that directory. The database can be found in: `[Kindle directory]/system/vocabulary/vocab.db`.
Install Anki, and check if you have `${XDG_DATA_HOME}/Anki2/User\ 1/collection.media` folder. It stores audio and picture files.

==== Translation
Optionally, translation can be added to the `dictionary.tsv` file. I recommend importing this file to your Google Drive's Spreadsheet. In the second column, use the `GOOGLETRANSLATE` formula. Here's an example of translating English words into Polish:

	=GOOGLETRANSLATE(A1; "en";"pl")

Save this spreadsheet as a `TSV` file and replace the existing `dictionary.tsv` file.

==== Importing to Anki
Anki's desktop application requires a template and custom fields for more advance cards. Documentation can be found in https://docs.ankiweb.net/templates/intro.html[Card Templates].  To prepare your deck, follow these steps:

. go to menu:Tools[Manage Note Types]
. click the `Add` button and create a new notetype
. add fields - https://docs.ankiweb.net/editing.html?highlight=templa#customizing-fields[Anki Manual]
. go to the `Cards` window and copy templates and style from `templates` location in this repository.
. import `dictionary.tsv` by clicking menu:File[Import]

In our case, templates require following fields. Enable html formatting if necessary.

.Fields
. Word
. Category
. Picture (enable html)
. Pronunciation (enable html)
. Vocabulary
. Translation
. Definition
. Example (enable html)

==== AnkiDroid
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki&hl=en_US&gl=US[AnkiDroid] is a free Android application which can use flashcards generated in Anki. There are two options to import cards. 
The first is to synchronize the desktop app with  https://ankiweb.net/[ankiweb.net] in order to download flashcards and your progression from your account. 
It's also possible to export an "Anki Deck Package" (.apkg) file and import it to the AnkiDroid. In order to do that, click on menu:File[Export], and choose the `apkg` format, your deck. Select `Include media` for adding audios and pictures.

=== Configuration
User configuration is stored in ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/kindle2anki/config.properties`.
It's necessary to provide `api.key` from https://dictionaryapi.com/register/index[Merriam-Webster Dictionary].
For confidence, change `vocab.db.path` of the Kindle database in mounted device or override others properties.
